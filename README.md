#pdfSaver

pdfSaver is an application combining the openFrameworks pdfExample with a couple of gui functions.

**pdfSaver gui features:**
- save button - saves a pdf screenshot every time the - button is pressed
- color control - control the color of moving box and tail


Note: The original multi-page rendering capability has been commented out in this code. Commented out render code includes a call to render through a key press or gui toggle.
